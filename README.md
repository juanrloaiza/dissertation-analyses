This repository has some analyses I did on my dissertation "Emotions as functional kinds: a meta-theoretical approach to constructing scientific theories of emotions" (HU Berlin).

It includes two Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Preprocessing

2. Basic analyses

Some interesting figures I extracted from this data include common word pairings (i.e. bigrams and trigrams), which show clearly what my dissertation is about, and some the most cited texts.
